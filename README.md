# sms-forwarder
An Open Source SMS Forwarder app for Android.
There are several SMS Forwarder apps available in every app store but none of them are open source and therefore none of them can be trusted.
The dev can easily include a piece of code to spy on your presonal messages. I was able to find one open source app but the functionality of the app was limited to forwarding SMS from only certain numbers to a number. In case of OTPs, they are sent from dynamically alloted IDs. So, a Regrex was essential to make it work.
This app will be forever free to use and Ad-Free as this is 100% run from the phone and I don't need to host it anywhere. It does NOT collect any of your private data.
This is also my first app which I am publishing in any store.
